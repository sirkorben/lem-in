# LEM-IN

A program to find the shortest way from point A to point B with varying number of paths and units to move.

## Description

The program reads a .txt file and gathers data from it, like the number of ants, rooms and connections between the rooms. The program then finds the fastest combination of movements of ants from one room to another and prints out the detailed journey of every ant from start-room to end-room. Different data structures and algorithms were used to build the project and find the most efficient solution.
